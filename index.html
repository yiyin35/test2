                        <p>
                            Let’s face it. You might be a little bit heavier than you were when the pandemic started. Your healthy eating habits 
                            might have stalled in the past year. And you can’t remember the last time you went to the doctor. Now, you’re vaccinated, 
                            or if possible, you will be soon. Restrictions are lifting. And you want to get your health back on track.

                        <p>
                            As you get older, it can be easy to find excuses to let yourself slow down. Maybe your joints ache. Maybe you’re carrying a 
                            few extra pounds. Maybe you didn’t get enough sleep. But it’s important to get some activity in your life—exercise is vitally
