                        As you get older, it can be easy to find excuses to let yourself slow down. Maybe your joints ache. Maybe you’re carrying a few extra 
                        pounds. Maybe you didn’t get enough sleep. But it’s important to get some activity in your life—exercise is vitally important for seniors.<br><br>
                        “Exercise improves your quality of life, meaning everything from how much activity we can do to what kind of mood we’re in,” 
                        said Kristina Balangue, MD, a geriatrician at Banner – University Medical Center Phoenix. “It helps improve all aspects of health, 
                        from feeling like you have a better quality of life to helping with chronic pain and depression.”<br><br>
                        Follow these five steps to add more activity to your life.<br><br><br>

                        <h3>Step 1: Talk to your doctor about your plans</h3>
                        <p>If you’ve become inactive, it’s good to talk to your primary care provider before you start increasing your activity. “You should discuss 
                        what your current level of activity is, activities that you’re having problems completing, any recent falls you’ve had and if you use a 
                        walking aid such as a cane,” Dr. Balangue said.</p><br><br>
                        <h3>Step 2: Keep it simple at first</h3>
                        <p>You don’t want to overdo your activity too soon and feel overwhelmed or injure yourself. Something as simple as walking to the mailbox or 
                        around the block, or parking farther away from the door when grocery shopping might be a good place to begin. “Start low and go slow,” Dr. 
                        Balangue said. “Work week by week to increase your level of activity slowly and safely.”</p><br><br>

                        <h3>Step 3: When you get stronger, increase your activity</h3>
                        <p>As your fitness level increases, you can add more exercise to your routine. Make your walks longer, sign up for a fitness class or work out 
                        at a gym. And include both aerobic and strength training exercises in your routine. “Weight-lifting isn’t just for professional sports 
                        players and young adults,” Dr. Balangue said. “It is super-important to do strength training to maintain your functionality as a senior 
                        and to build strong bones.”</p><br><br>

                        <h3>Step 4: Remember to drink plenty of water</h3>
                        <p>“One of the biggest health concerns we encounter that is easily preventable is staying hydrated,” Dr. Balangue said. Your doctor can 
                        recommend the amount of water you should be drinking every day. Staying hydrated is more important than ever as you get older.</p><br><br>

                        <h3>Step 5: If you’re struggling, reach out for help</h3>
                        <p>If you have health conditions that are making exercise a challenge for you, talk to your primary care provider. “Physical therapy, occupational 
                        therapy, balance training and exercise programs are all things your primary care provider can talk with you about,” Dr. Balangue said.</p><br><br><br>
