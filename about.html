                <h3>You’re on a journey to health and wellness. And we’re right there with you.</h3>
                <p>
                    How you feel affects every single day of your life, which is why you work so hard to get well and stay well. 
                    No matter your journey, we’re here to support, guide, and inspire you.<br><br>
                    We cut through the confusion with straightforward, expert-reviewed, person-first experiences — 
                    all designed to help you make the best decisions for yourself and the people you love.<br><br>
                </p>
    
                <h4>We want to help you own your well-being.</h4>
                <p>
                    Live Healthy covers all facets of physical and mental health openly and objectively because we’re here for the whole person — 
                    for your whole life. And because people come to us with unique challenges we listen closely and put empathy first across our organization. 
                    In everything from our personal perspectives to our commitment to inclusivity, you’ll see that we feel with you.<br><br>
    
                    We hope you tap into all of Healthline’s resources — from our health and wellness library and newsletters to our apps, podcasts, and communities.<br><br>
